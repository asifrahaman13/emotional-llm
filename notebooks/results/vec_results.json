    "query": "My only pet died last week. I am feeling very lonely. What should I do?",
    "response without context": "I'm so sorry to hear that your pet passed away. Losing a beloved companion can be a really tough experience, especially if they were your only pet.\n\nFirstly, allow yourself to grieve and process your emotions. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or nostalgic - these are all normal reactions to losing a loved one. Take some time to reflect on the memories you shared with your pet, and cherish those moments.\n\nNow, let's talk about ways to cope with loneliness:\n\n1. **Reach out to friends and family**: Talk to people who care about you, even if it feels like they don't fully understand what you're going through. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can help you feel heard and validated.\n2. **Consider getting a new pet (but only when you're ready)**: If you're feeling up for the responsibility, a new furry friend could bring joy back into your life. However, make sure you're emotionally prepared to care for another pet before bringing one home.\n3. **Try volunteering or helping friends with their pets**: Helping others with their pets can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment without the long-term commitment.\n4. **Get involved in activities you enjoy**: Reconnect with hobbies, join a club or group that aligns with your interests, or take up a new sport to meet like-minded people.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising regularly, and engaging in relaxing activities like reading, yoga, or meditation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time to heal and adjust to this new phase in your life. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything specific that resonates with you, or would you like more ideas?",
