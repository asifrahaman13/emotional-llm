        "solution": "Solution: Hello, what would you like to talk about? What makes your job stressful for you? Do you help your clients to make it to a better financial situation? But you offer them a better future than what they have currently. It may not be what they wanted, but it helps them in the long run. I can understand that.  Is there another job that would pay you close to what you currently make? Is it possible to reframe how you look at your clients' dire financial situations? Some people can't do what you do because they don't have the heart to give someone else bad news. The reality is though, someone needs to fill that role and you do help people I've had to deal with collections before when I was in  bad financial condition. The person on the other line was really helpful though. She was understanding, It may not be for you. I think you should think about the pros and cons of keeping your position. It might make things clearer for you.  I wouldn't stay if it really impacts your mental health in a negative way. Still, you may need to zoom out and see the bigger picture: that you provide a needed service and you do it compassionately No doubt, but you know in your heart what is right for you.  It's no problem. I hope you can make a decision about this situation and then be at peace with it Ok, take care",

        "solution": "Solution: Hello how are you? I'm doing ok I'm glad you are good. Is it snowing by you? Merry Christmas! How can I help you today? I hear you are having trouble figuring out which friends are really your friends and which ones aren't. Is that about right? I understand that... Did something happen that makes you feel like that? Is this a significant other? Are they ignoring you? Are you sure they are okay? Or not away with family for the holidays? That's no good what do you think the problem is? Do you owe someone already? That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but I try not to get ahead of myself and  jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up... That very well could be... Are you working? I see, Have you tried for unemployment? I understand that. What if that is the case? You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that. How long has this been going on? I understand that, but if you want to get to a point that you feel better about it then you will have to speak to them. Do you see them everyday? I understand that, are you able to go over there. Well I can see that you have put the effort in to try and keep the relationship so it sounds like the ball is in their court if they want to do the same. Well that is about all that can be done and wait for them to come around...Do you have  any hobbies? I like to go on runs every morning. It helps to clear my mind and makes it easier to brush things off when they bother me. What instrument do you play? It is a really good stress reliever. I played when I  was younger, didn't ever get very good. Did you? Hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, We can always strive to be better at everything we do. Maybe take a run in order to clear your mind. I'm sure they will come around. That may be a good idea. Good talk to them and may find out that it was never anything against you I sometimes get ahead of myself and try to figure out what is going on and thinking that it was something I did. You are right too. COVID has stressed everyone out to the max. It has been a crazy year I am glad that it is almost over. I'm sure it will. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No problem, I hope everything works out for you and your friends. Have a great New Year! Good day!",

Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?  Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?  (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) So you have been getting some assistance?  I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank?  I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now.  I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all.  That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!  Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too.  So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right?  That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :)  It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope.  That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a  thing?  That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best for the coming months. I am glad that you'd not roll over and accept ill treatment! Well done :)  I am afraid I need to leave now but thank you for talking :) (can you press the quit button and take the survey?) Best wishes! You too!",

Do you have an online support network?  Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time? I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that I can talk to.  Sometimes it does just make it easier to know that other people are in the same situation as you :)  Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps?  Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now?  Could you perhaps set up Zoom meetings where you could play together online?  No I don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person.  I hope it goes well for you. It has been such an awful year, hasn't it?  I wish you all the very best for 2021. I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!  Yes, all we need to do is be patient! Have a great New Year and thanks for talking.",

Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment?  Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended?  Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this.  From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen.  Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?  And he's still married?  I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?  It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already.  How do your children feel about this? And his?  Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt  I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over.  But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :(  Well it surely could not be worse :) (sorry was afk let me catch up)\n Is it possible she is suffering from depression?  It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position  And how does she feel about you?  I think it would be better if he  were able to come to a sensible financial solution with her. This situation is damaging for everyone.  I hope I have been able to have been of some help to you :) A very happy New Year to you!  You just need to press quit and take the survey - it has to be done at your end :)",

Are you prepared to take jobs that are below your usual level just to get by for a while?  It's a very difficult time to be out of work, I know. I hope that there is something out there for you. Have you tried employment agencies?  Well, on the plus side at least you do have savings .. hopefully this can give you some security for a while  Are your family being supportive of your situation?  Perhaps bankruptcy might not be a bad option? You would be eligible for some help then at least.  So you feel as though you have been working hard all your life and now you need help and support and are not getting it  I know how you feel .. I sometimes feel I would have been better off if I'd just not bothered working!  Anyway thank you for talking and I really hope things go better for you in the future :)  You're welcome :) You need to press quit first and take the survey before I can :)  hello? :)  Please can you quit and take the survey. I cannot do it till you do and neither of us will get paid if I have to quit. Yes it's been done :)  Please can you quit.

I do gig work online too but it can be very difficult to find any. I think a lot more people are working online due to the pandemic.  Are you struggling financially at the moment, then?  I have not but I appreciate the recommendation! I think that we all need to come together and help each other at this time.  Are you aware that there are organisations that can offer a little help at this time? Food banks for instance, though I know some people feel awkward about accepting such help.  I have had to use foodbanks once or twice this year and I did feel a bit bad about it but everyone there was very kind and no-one judged us.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in doing so and when you get to a better position you can give back to them.  Do you feel you will be getting the vaccine when it is rolled out where you are?  That is a good idea - yes, I will get it. I think and hope it will help 2021 to be a better year than 2020 has been!  So, you feel that the New Year might be a turning point for us all?  Yes it might take a little while - we are definitely not out of the woods yet and people do need to stick to the regulations to try to mitigate the situation.  I sincerely hope that things pick up for you and for all of us. And that online work remains plentiful :D  Anyway it has been lovely to talk to you, enjoy the rest of your Christmas Day!

Would a date night at home with take-out and a movie just the two of you be an option? Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor? Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self-care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self-care is. I know from experience that our self esteem suffers when we're in an unhappy marriage.

        "solution": "Solution: When did you lose your job? I feel bad for you, but there are options. I suggest working on your resume and hitting job boards. Was it just you that lost the job or a whole unit/department? Google your past job title title and add openings. Was it a computer job or a job where you have to be working in-person? May I suggest Uber, Lyft, Door Dash or Grub Hub or Uber Eats? Do you have a car to use as a delivery driver? I read that all you need is to wear a mask as you drive around to put up and deliver food to the masses. Plus, gas prices are relatively cheap at 2.25 a gallon, nationally. You can also send out flyers to do dog walking in the neighborhood. Do you like doggies? Or are you a cat person? I feel that you seem to be taking to food delivery. I did food delivery for three different companies and I have liked it. You seem to be a real go-getter from the short conversation that we have had so far. I worked in the restaurant business about a decade ago, but restaurants need so many people to deliver their food. When I was younger, the food delivery business was minimal. I feel that if you start applying now for those jobs and you have a decent car, there is plenty of opportunity to make money with Grub Hub and Uber Eats\n The survivor rate from COVID-19 infections is around 99%, so your chances of dying from the virus are still low. I suggest taking Vitamin D3 and Zinc to protect against the virus.  I take a ton of vitamins. They say that the immune system can combat a lot of nasty crud if it is strong.

I bet once you get into it again it will all come back to you. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part. I think that if you got a B once, you can do it again, and if you really want it, which you clearly do, you can do anything! Aim for an A, you can do it! And you too, good luck!",

        "solution": "Solution: Hey there! How are you feeling today? Is something troubling you? I'm sorry to hear that. I know how bad it can feel when life throws you a curve-ball. Can you tell me about your situation? Oh dear. That is a very upsetting situation. It sounds like you might be feeling lonely and rejected as a result of your girlfriend breaking up with you. Is that right? That's a long time. I was in a similar situation not too long ago and I understand how hard this must be for you. During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain. Is there something you can do to take your mind off of it until you're ready to manage your feelings? Okay, that's very understandable. I'm sure there's another strategy we can come up with. Do you have a friend or family member you can talk about your feelings with? That's great. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help and that's a big deal! A good next step might be letting the people around you know that you need some support at this time. Sometimes people don't know something until you tell them, even if it seems obvious. Is that something you can do? Okay, I understand. Do you feel embarrassed because this is happening to you? I understand that your feelings of sadness run very deep. Do you have people in your life who you can safely spend time with without necessarily talking about your feelings? Feeling connected to people can help quite a lot. It's great that you have someone who can give you positivity and support. Do you feel comfortable with trying that or would you like to explore other options? It might be helpful to simply spend some time together. Connecting with someone who cares about you can help reassure your positive feelings in yourself. If you feel able to, something outdoors might be good. Fresh air and physical activity can help lower anxiety and doing a mutual activity can help strengthen bonds between people. Yes, that's a great idea! It sounds like you're already better at this than you think. Fantastic. I hope this strategy works for you and helps you feel better. Exactly! You don't have to do anything that you're not comfortable with. Feeling strong is very empowering but it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes too. There are no wrong answers here. Do you feel good about the strategies you can use or would you like to continue exploring your options? That's wonderful! You already have the tools to work through this. I wish you all the best!

I was in a very similar situation at a previous job when departments were reorganized and I ended up working for someone who wasn't familiar with my work. It was a challenge and frustrating. While I know jobs are scarce right now, do you think you might consider at least taking a look at some job sites, doing some searches just to see if there are some other jobs you might be interested in?

It sounds like you are thinking about a specific person a lot of the time. Is there anything you can think of that would help you to feel better? It sounds like things ended in an unresolved way. That can make it feel like there is no real conclusion. yes, there is a lag in the system. it takes a while for the response to upload Yes, I agree. Sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions. Yes, that's a good point. It sounds like you are thinking this through in a good way, but the emotions are hard to process. Letting yourself feel the emotions is an important part of getting through a difficult situation. It is understandable to want to keep photos. Distracting yourself might not be the solution; that could stop you from processing the emotions. There is a stage of grieving for a lost relationship that happens when a relationship ends. There will be grieving for the person, and for the relationship with that person. That is what has to be processed in order to move on. That makes sense; you care about him so you miss him. This is one of those things that will take time. Accepting and acknowledging the emotions, even when they are painful, will let the emotions evolve and over time they will become less painful.  Yes, it must be a painful experience. The end of a relationship is a loss, and there is a grieving process to go through. That is a painful experience. I am sorry you have to go through this.

That's a lot to take in around the holidays.\n Getting a new puppy might be a way to make you feel happy during this dark time in your life.  \n It might be just what you need to have something to wake up and look forward to each day.  Especially during times like now when everyone is spending so much time alone inside.\n I completely agree.  Having a dog as a companion has been a life saver to me in so many situations.\n Having a playmate for the dog will make it easier to justify leaving when you do need to go back to work in the office.  The puppy won't be lonely.\n I have a yellow lab!  He's great!\n I'd suggest a dog with a lot of energy if you like to workout!  What kind of dog did you have previously?\n Just from talking to you, it sounds like working from home is a great fit for you! Pomeranians are such cute dogs!  They always look like they're smiling!

That is a very long time, I had a girlfriend and I was very vested in her and her family. She broke up with me around Christmas time as well. It has been awhile, but I remember getting her gift and it was over sometime afterwards. Do you have any co-workers or involvement with any local groups/organizations/church?

It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home? Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't.  Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.

I think the best thing in these situations is to take time doing things that make you happy. Pamper yourself. Indulge in things that make you feel good and help you feel better about yourself. Something like a spa day. Get a beauty treatment. Pamper yourself then you will have an attitude that will help you move on. What do you think?",

It seems like you're worried about your abilities as well as your team leader potentially being disappointed with your performance. Am I understanding that correctly? That's lovely to hear. Have you tried discussing your doubts with your supervisor? There are times where I've felt overwhelmed, but maybe they could provide some additional guidance or someone to help assist you with the project. Is there an impending deadline for the project you're worried about meeting? Maybe you could contact them through email or another form of outreach. I can understand how stressful that must be, with the business of the holiday season on top of a looming deadline. Is there anyone else you can potentially contact to discuss changing the deadline?  That sounds like a wonderful idea! That's what a teammate is there for after all. I'm sure they'd love to help. Is there anything else on your mind today? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today? Awesome! Have a wonderful holiday season :)",

That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance. Do you regret choosing to go to the school near where she lives? Definitely feeling like you're living for someone else and having them not do the same is hurtful. Although it seems like you're the one in the relationship who is willing to make more sacrifices Oh ok then it's not the first time this has happened.  I think you might be right, if you notice a pattern then it might continue to happen Most likely, she seems to need space to live for herself and is less willing to make sacrifices for you like you do for her But even it won't happen again, you shouldn't have to live worrying that it will Have you spoken to her about how you feel? Wow I can only imagine. But I think it wasn't a waste if there were good times and you had room to grow. In relationships you have to prioritize your own happiness and I'm sure if you mentioned that you're frustrated and hurt maybe you can understand how she feels and why she made the decisions she made Absolutely not! Individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world.  I think it's important that you talk to her and get the answers you need. She might not even have been aware you feel this way and assumed you were happy to move for her.  Although again, I'm really sorry you have to go through this during the holidays, definitely sucks but doesn't mean you can't at least get some answers and move on with your life Thank you for talking to me! I hope it all works out",

Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure?\n Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time.\n Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.  Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.\n Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.\n I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues.  Have you other friends? Yes, and as you grow and mature, your life goals change, not everyone will travel with you. Right now you are starting out, I'm in the retired stage, lol Now I'm interested in helping younger people. It's amazing how our priorities change.  I've basically figured out life only makes sense with God, and I don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it.  A LOT of people have no goals. I think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year.  I think self reflection is good for us.  A young neighbor just stopped by today, and he just moved out of his home, he is consumed with HOW do I pay the electric, HOW do I budget? How do I cook?  lol Like it is so interesting to see the journey in life. And my faith in Jesus Christ is really the most important thing.  Do pray for your friend, and I will say a prayer too. Maybe he will come around some day?\n I had two brothers die from alcohol and drugs. I had to learn not to enable them. Sadly, people choose their own life. There is opportunity to get sober, my husband is a recovered alcoholic.  When hanging with them and they do not want to change, sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away and let them hit bottom.  I have 2 brothers that DID find recover and a sister too. So my whole life was filled with people drinking and drugging. And I didn't want that life.  there's a prayer called the serenity prayer, I don't know if you are familiar with it, but it is used in AA and NA a lot, learning to let go of what we cannot change, and that is people,",

So an updated profile will show you jobs that you can apply that fit your skillset.  I would go to the \"jobs\" section in the menu and see what jobs you like best.

When I am stressed, I usually take a brisk walk of 30 to 45 minutes. They say that fresh our is really good for releasing stress.  Do you have acupuncturists or holistic healers near you? I try and walk and get fresh air almost daily. I love parks and paths to walk through. Well, shoveling can be good for releasing tension in the body by exercising by shoveling, even though it is short. I like doing a little shoveling but you have to do it right, as to not wear out your back. Do you like snow? We had a rain storm for hours on Christmas Eve. I wanted a little snow to make things look nice. Are my suggestions helping any? Well, there are incense pots that allow you to close you eyes and feel the glow of the meditation sticks.  Certain scents can release stress. Do you have any on the home that you can burn? I have heard good things about Palo Santo sticks and rosemary / lavender oils that can calm and relax,  Do you have any music or sound effects that you can listen to as to be able to relax? I suggest rosemary oils all the time.  Getting a few quaffs can calm the nerves. Listening to calming sound effects like running creek  water in the woods or dolphins communicating could put you in a good mood.  They say its best to stop those racing thoughts and breath in a steady pace. Do you need any other insights? You've done great at telling me your thoughts and deep feelings. Ok.

I understand that loss is a painful thing to go through and can take us a while to learn to cope with it. I take it you two were close? I completely understand that. It is important to be able to let yourself heal. Don't beat yourself up over things that we can't control. What do you mean? I think that you need to understand that  things happen about of our control and to not just accept it and forget it, but maybe put a day aside every year to celebrate her life. My grandmother was amazing, and loved burritos, so we used to make them together. After she passed, we started making them as a family in order to celebrate the life she had and memories of her.  That helps us all remember not her death, but her life and the good memories in a way that would show her how much you do care. Do you celebrate Christmas? I do, Merry Christmas to you too! It has been a very different year, I am glad we are nearing the end of it. Is there anything else I can help you with? I understand that I am glad to listen. It helps me just as much.

        "solution": "Solution: Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\n So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?\n I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.  For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\n Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\n Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.\n Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.  Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. \n HOw man classes do you have?\n many * That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing.\n If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart.  You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!",

One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due? I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.  Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable? Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually. It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking. Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.  That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.  I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too. Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!  It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments! My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.  Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at.  I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success.  You are very welcome. Have a blessed evening!!",

        "solution": "Solution: Good evening, how are you feeling today?  I am sorry, I gather life is not going well for you right now? Would you like to talk about it?  I am more than happy to listen and to help if I can. I do know how bad things can get at this time of year.  Let's take things one at a time .. have you lost your job recently?  Yes, I can understand that jobs are very hard to come by right now \n Well that is one positive thing. Can you tell me a little about the guy you are afraid to open up to?  Well, I would recommend not taking things too quickly but relationships online CAN work - I met my fiance of ten years online.  But we did take it very slowly and talked for a year before we met in person.  Well, if he is reliable then he will be happy to wait till you are ready to meet. Where do you live, do you mind me asking?  Ah well definitely do not contemplate meeting him whilst the pandemic is on! But it might be  good excuse to put things off for a bit, do you think?  I do think that it might be a while before travel in Europe fully opens up again. Things are not good here.  I am in the UK. The pandemic is very bad here at the moment.  Two more! It's very scary and I don't recommend coming either here or continental Europe right now.  So, I hear you saying that you are a bit wary of the relationship and do not know if it can work in the real world?  Turkish people are lovely and welcoming - you should not worry about that :). But don't let yourself be pushed into anything you don't feel ready for  Yes I know a few Turkish people. They're very nice people, don't listen to any stereotypes!  I do understand how trying new things can be very difficult - this is something that I struggle with myself. But - if you don't take a chance, how can you know what might have happened?  I really hope that I have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through. I wish you a very happy holiday season!  It's Christmas Day here now but you too!

What type of rejection  are you experiencing I hate to ask you this but are you male or female? I ask it changes the perception on how I may help you because male and females deal with things differently. I am going to ask you a few questions if OK i don't want to sound like i am prying. OK do yo live in a rural or city, are you into male females or the like? I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection. I understand doing that I have tried it myself and trying to find that connection is few and far between. What sites have you tried using? Well It would depend on if you were religious I  would suggest church functions for example. I use my hobbies like pool and darts and cards and join groups that creates some common ground. I have and i usually take someone i  trust with me and if it doesnt feel right I leave.

Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?  I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is.  Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it. Have you had any contact with her since?  That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to  Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus  Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help.  I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your  tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world.  Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise.  Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away  I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem.  Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her  I hope that I have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me  You're welcome. Have a lovely festive season! I feel that all will be better in the coming year.

Ah - so I hear you saying you are tempted to be unfaithful to your marriage vows?  Well I must say that as a woman I would not allow it either ;)  It does sound like it. Are there any other problems in your marriage that might be making you unhappy or is it generally okay and you just want someone else too?  Have you considered getting some sort of marriage guidance counselling? There are people out there who might be able to help you both  I think it sounds as though you might be pushing her into things she is not ready for though. Have you considered that you might be the problem?  No, I do not think you should say that! At least you recognise that you are not behaving well, which is the first step on the road to making things better.  Perhaps you could consider individual counselling to overcome your own problems before you think of couples' therapy?  Porn can be helpful for a relationship but it can also be damaging.  Well, perhaps it would be better for you to learn that you can't just do that even though you want to :)  I am forty five, fat and married :). I do recommend talking to someone though.  I am glad you were able to confide a little in me and hope it is the first step on the road to a happier marriage.

Well as a neutral individual i would be willing to listen to your concerns and or stressors. It can help to be able to vent to someone without judgement. I see, it must feel like a lot of pressure to get so much done during an already hectic season.  Well first off that is normal to feel that way. I think most of us do but just don't speak up about it. Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on.\nHowever You should try to take some time out of each day to instead of question yourself to congratulate yourself, because you are doing tough things on your own but hey youre DOING IT!  For anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself  Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety\n Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress.  Would you like any links to a webpage or group that may also have tips or advice?

Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. I'm actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren't hurting for money. You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress. I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day. I feel so much more relaxed after running and it seems that nothing can hurt me after that.

What type of movie were you trying to watch? Maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.  I would recommend games like Heartstone for stragedy, WoW for more role playing and if your into sci-fi, Cyberpunk cam out recently.  Really any game that has multiplayer would be a good fit!

The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn't one thing it's another. I'm sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn't your fault. Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times.  Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies? I don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives. Exercise also  releases endorphins that can make you feel happy. I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself.

Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings. Exactly, that is a burden that children should never have to endure. They are always the innocent victims in our personal problems. True! How old are they? They should hopefully be young enough not to want details. Maybe if they ask say he didn't give you details because he apparently doesn't know himself what he wants. You sound like a very caring mother who wants the very best for her children. I have a daughter and we have went through something similar in the past so I can relate. The truth is, I have found over time that it is our children who get us through these tough time. You will get through this and come out ahead in the long run, just stay strong!",

        "solution": "Solution: Hello there, how are you? I'm very sorry to hear that, did something not go as planned recently? I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle? It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged. It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain. Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat? Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already. On the contrary, I think you might not be allowing yourself to ask enough! Sometimes, the people who are closest to us can actually become even more anxious about how something might affect your feelings. It could be the case with him too Some people express themselves best through their actions. Have you tried suggesting a meeting for something you'd usually do to see if they're willing to hang out just as always?",

        "solution": "Solution: Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it.  yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?  Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.  I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing.  My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.  yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent.  I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so. Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work. Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale.  That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.  I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays.",

I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor? I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can.  You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right. Why do you think that might be?

Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before.

Remember that you may not know the whole story.  I, too, have made assumptions that affection my outlook and caused anxiety.\n My assumptions were often wrong.  Ok. Have you thought about a plan? When you tell your family, it may help to state your planned actions. This may help with feelings of uncertainty, both theirs and yours.\n When I have been in a similar situation, I started reaching out to my network of friends and coworkers before I was let go. I know. This is the worst time of year for this news. Surprisingly, it happens very often. Having 2 months of savings is FANTASTIC! More than most people.  Do you anticipate any roadblocks to finding new employment in your industry?\n I understand your feelings. The holidays are a joyous time. No place for uncertainty. Do you think that outlining a plan of action, and sharing that with your family will help turn this around a bit? Perhaps, think about as looking forward to a better opportunity in your future? The stimulus has helped a lot of people get through this tough time. Sounds like you will feel much more secure knowing that you will have some income, and not have to use your savings that you worked so hard for. It's a wonderful thing to love your job. I love mine, as well, and would feel bad if it were put at risk. Your hard work and savings will get you through, no matter what happens or the gods decree. You have demonstrated that you can take care of yourself and your family. I can say that many friends of mine have found new jobs, most have left their old ones willingly for new opportunities. There are out there. Consider making your plan of action, regardless of what happens with the stimulus. THis is an unprecedented time. There may be ways to...use it to your advantage.\n You, too.

Oh I see my mom has also done this in the past. Sometimes I wonder who raised who? That is the worst. I ended up having to cut my mom out of my life. Sometimes it is for the best to set clear boundries. Is Grand mother ashamed of you or her daughter? I feel it should be her ashamed of her daughter. At least that is a good thing to come out of a bad situation. I do not think that would have a reflection on you. It should only reflect on your mom. It may be nice to have a bonus house for the future. But even that comes with headaches. In the end you have to do what is best for you.  Or sell it now and pocket the money to recoup what was lost. So she is just talking circles and not accomplishing what she says? Some people do choose that life to be free of responsibility. Have you had a talk with her about seeing a mental health professional, She may be having some issues that would benefit from care.  Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others.  A good first step is taking her to your local mental health provider. Or ask at a major emergency room where this is located as sometimes the places are hard to find.  Without treatment she may just be getting worse. That is good to hear.. That does make it difficult when a partner encourages you to engage in unhealthy behavior. I suggest talking to your girlfriend about how it makes you feel when she insists you continue a relationship that causes so much pain.  It was nice talking to you.",

I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study? Meditation is essentially focussing on breathing, you could start by closing your eyes and slowly breathe in an out. From what you're saying to me, I feel that you don't believe in yourself very much.\n I've struggled with the same thing before, whenever I doubt myself I look back at all i've accomplished and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I can do it. It has worked well for me. Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam! I'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors! I have two actually! 1. Do not procrastinate as that will only cause you more stress and 2. Believe in yourself!

When I start to feel alone and missing my family or friends, I usually like the plan a skype or group facetime session right after I get off of work.

I am sure with a bit of trial and error, hosting a movie or game night would be a breeze for you too! Having this winter sadness, especially around holiday times, may be a sign of seasonal depression.  I have had seasonal depression in the past, and going on nature hikes and bike rides has helped me a lot.

I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours? That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.

A far as I am aware there are charitable organisations which can arrange a few free therapy session for you. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about it?  I have had free therapy sessions before and I found them very helpful  It would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are.

Could you tell me what is going on?\n I can definetely imagine how stressful the last week of school can be, especially taking 5 courses instead of 4.\n However, don't let this situation scare you or ruin  your holidays. There are ways to cope with said stress.\n First of all, do you have some academic counselor you can talk to? Help you organize your ideas or classwork? Can you refer to professors or fellow classmates for help?\n Are you confident in your abilities to succeed in those classes or you think you might lack the materials or knowledge? Or perhaps time?\n It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and I think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them.\n That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major.\n Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself!\n It's important than you take your time.\n I understand that college can be financially demanding.\n You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it.\n Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you\n any good. Do you feel better after talking about all of this?\n Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety.

I understand. I know how hard it can be to open up about what is worrying you. I've been in that position too.  Oh I am so sorry! That is a really unpleasant thing to do to someone, especially at this time of year.  Is there anyone close to you that you can talk to about this? Friends?  Yes it is a very cowardly thing to do. I am quite disgusted that she did not have the courage to talk to you face to face too. You have every right to feel angry.  Unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. I have experienced that myself.  It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point.  It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better.  Yes I do. I would not personally do that to someone even if I was unhappy in  relationship.  Yes I have been dumped. We had been together for eight years and he left me for another woman.  I know how you are feeling but I think that you need to get professional help to move on. Are you able to go to therapy?  Well, I think it could be really beneficial to let your anger out  That would be an absolutely terrible thing to do. Do you really think that your friend would do a t hing like that to you?  Do you think that perhaps you should talk to him before anything happens? You do not want to ruin your friendship by having him do that  Well you do not want to let that situation escalate any further. I hope I have been able to be of some help to you and I urge you to look for professional therapy if you can. All the best to you for Christmas and the year 2021!  Yes you really should. All the best and thanks for talking.",

That's okay, just wanted to reach out and see how you are! Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that.  So it sounds a bit like you are entering a period of uncertainty and are going to be struggling :( Well i know it is difficult, but just wanted to share that I am here for you in these hard times.  And you're so smart that even if you lose this job you will find another one :) Actually currently I am unemployed too actually, although I have a new opportunity starting next month.  So I know it can be rough  Well have you thought of any next steps to take?  From what I have seen, it is easier to start looking for a new job before you need to leave the old one.  Maybe you could start job searching sooner rather than later?  I might have some contacts that can help Awesome! Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you in these tough times.  It can be useful to take some time to relax too :) Maybe eat a favorite food or talk with a friend or go on a long walk to destress :) Awesome, meditation can always help make complex problems feel a bit simpler.  And it is okay to feel upset right now, as long as you realize that things will get better, and that you have lots of people supporting you! Anything else i can help you with? Or are you going to go meditate now? You're welcome! Hope you have a wonderful week :)  Always good to chat Of course! Yup, again, it is always great to reach out since other people might be going through the same struggles!  I was feeling upset until I messaged you and now I feel happier! Bye! You're welcome!",

        "problem": "Problem: I am very scare of this pandemic call COVID-19",
        "solution": "Solution: Hi! How are you tonight? Glad to hear that! Is there some way I can encourage you? :D What is the worst part of it for you? Can you identify that? I'll be honest, my husband and I don't even see anyone dying.  Half your neighbors died? So do you think you can identify the most difficult problem you have? Maybe we can look at that and possible find better ways to cope? I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it.  I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want.  One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well.\n As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals.  It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong. I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you.  One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>  Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive. Sometimes this takes time, but it works.  Just because you feel sad doesn't mean you should just do nothing, a person can TALK their way out of sadness and choose to do something different.  I am glad you were able to talk about how this is affecting you. I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better. If you feel down, talk about it, pray about it but do NOT dwell on it, because that will bring you down. Sometimes we get in a funk, when we do, we can pull ourselves out, I do suggest you write a list of things to do and put on the frige. Thank you, how very sweet!  I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D I had one more thought about when the ambulance comes by and you get upset. Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go.  I cannot worry about what is not my job. I have a home and family to care for and pets and neighbors.  So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine. When I try to do their job and worry all about them and the sick people, it's not my job and there will be no peace doing the wrong job. If that makes sense.  If that is all, then you simply finish the hit. I am sure you will do just fine!   You are very welcome! Goodbye now and God bless you!",

Would you like to tell me more about ti?  Do you think that perhaps you feel numb to things that are going on even though you should be worried about them?  I see - that is interesting, I have never heard of anything like that before. Do you think that there might be some sort of physical problem going on?  Well, erm, thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you too. Yes fifteen minutes :D. Have you thought of making a list of goals for the New Year to motivate yourself?  I smoke too much too. It costs a lot and it's really bad for my health. I think I am gonna try and quit - again, sigh - in January too  Maybe try saving the money you save on cigarettes for a few months and then treat yourself to something really nice?  Nearly ten pounds a pack here (UK). I am gonna try and save up for a new handbag!  Everything is cheaper there than here :D. Do you have any fun plans for Christmas Day?  It will be nice to have a couple of stress free days ... assuming that they are stress free!  I hope you have a really nice Christmas and New Year too.

        "solution": "Solution: When did this fear start? It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job.  And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?  Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and I am proud of you for taking that leap! No problem I hope all goes well for you and I hope you stay safe. Goodbye!",

        "solution": "Solution: Cheating on you? How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married?\n How long have you been in a relationship with your man? So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. Sure, I understand. Yes, the workplace is not like home life.   Yes, trust matters. I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work.  If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life.  Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. How do you all generally communicate? Through text? Which do you and your man like to communicate? Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. I would be subtle about that tactic.   If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option.  Have you met any of his class mates? Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed. Sounds like drunk slander talk.

I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends. I joined volunteer groups to help others.  I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference. Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active. You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method. Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join. Did you need help with anything else? I understand the ADHD.  There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc. Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety. There is a group called, \"Harry House\" that provides support to those with ADHD and anxiety. Surely. Is there anything else you need help with? No, Habitat fir Humanity has car pools.  They are a good group to help you build meaningful relationships. I used to do a hour at a time; maybe one or twice a week. Would you be interested in something like HFH? Yes, you can sign up online to join a project. Yes, you can volunteer locally; HFH is nationwide. Any other questions? I am glad to assist. I have done volunteer work; people want to be friends with those who care and know how to use a nail and hammer. :) It may also help to contribute some money to keep the organization going.

        "solution": "Solution: Hello! How can I help you today? It's normal to feel nervous whenever we have an important assessment coming.\n I myself would always be really anxious whenever I had any finals back in college.\n I would suggest that you study as much as you can. The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel. I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule.\n I agree, once you have your career set up you won't have to worry about working and studying anymore. You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future.\n Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this!\n I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book.\n Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities.\n That's absolutely great, make good use of them (^_^)\n Is there anything else I can help you with today? No worries, you too!",

When it first started, I remember feeling lost and unsure about things that I would normally would have no problem with.\n If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?\n Do you have any family, girlfriend, boyfriend, children? Not seeing your closed ones or simply being apart from them can be more than enough to make us feel depressed or blue. Have you tried doing videocalls with them, for example?\n I understand. However, there is nothing wrong with telling them that you are sad because you miss them. Something as simple as getting it off your chest can already make you feel better.\n Totally, but remember than they are there for you whenever you need them.\n I bet something as simple as \"Hey babe, I really miss you. I can't be glad with your abscence\" could make your boyfriend feel loved while at the same time relieving you.\n That might be why you were unsure about telling them. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with showing vulnerability. We are all vulnerable in one way or another.\n Hey, if he is the right one for you, he will completeley accept you as you are and love you. In the unlikely event that he \"rejects\" you for being \"vulnerable\", he wasn't even worth it in the first place. You deserve someone that appreciates you as much as you appreciate them :3 I believe in you!\n It has been a pleasure! You too! (You have to hit Quit and fill the questionarie)",

        "solution": "Solution: Hello, how are you today\n I see. Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself.  What is making you angry about the past? I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens.   The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex.   Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently? Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical.  It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback? Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger. It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol.  Only if you think it will help. Do you think it will? No problem. I really hope that I was able to help you at least. I am still available if you want to discuss further. Like I said, I know how it feels because my ex hid from me 2 years that she was seeing someone else, so I can relate with you. Have a good day :)",

My aunt is a cancer survivor. I am sure your mother can make it too.\n From my knowledge, people usually recover from COVID after 2 to 3 weeks, you might consider having a doctor see your mother if she is still struggling.\n There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.\n I am sure he will be able to find a new job soon as new business start to open, even if it's a temporary one.

You should know each other's pet peeves by now.  can you explain some examples of reason why you fight. Birds of a feather flock together meaning that fighting with each other does not work and never will.   I want to know what you fight about to see if it is silly or not. Can you give me a few \"silly\" examples?  I wont be embarrassed.  As long as he is not physical abusive most things can be worked out due to communication. Try and find food that you both enjoy and compromise. say he wants pizza and you want chinese, say well you know what lets get a burger so neither of us win or loses. Tell him that if he wants his food he needs to leave you alone.  you need to sit down and have a serious talk with him. listen to me go to a table and comfortable table and stare at him straight in the eye.  Tell him your concerns that you are fighting too much and that it is ruining your love and relationship.  STARE INTO HIS EYES and see what he says. If he is evasive, the eyes are the windows into the soul.  Make him promise you that you will stop fighting or else you are going to find another man who will appreciate you. it's called the take-away in psychological sales. of course it will. look it up. do you love this man?

I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings? I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right? I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way? It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling? That's great!

That's a very important role for any business. I bet there are numerous other retailers out there looking for a good manager to hire. I see. Well then, if this helps.  The store closing might have been a positive thing, so you could find your next passion.  I will also add, that being a Manager means you have some very important skills that would translate well to your next job, or anything you decide to do. Also, let's say you decided to work for another company, something new, outside of retail. Because you were a manager, you could also be promoted more quickly because of your management experience.  Yes, it sounds like a part of you still misses the retail environment. I see that too. My best advice, is take a few days to think about what you really want to do.  Think about what you are skilled at. Then decide which route you want to go.  I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too. Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you.  that's possible. but you will have plenty of options either way. Could be a different retail store, or something new.  Yes, of course. Take some time to think it through. Weigh your options, and the pros and cons of each. Then pick the option that will be the most rewarding for you.  Thank you for talking with me.",

These are certainly difficult times and this pandemic doesn't seem to be stopping anytime now. I understand your frustation.\n Many apps offer videocalls that you can use to chat with your loved ones though. Zoom is a great one, fore example!\n It surely does. You can always travel, just make sure that you are maintaining social distancing and your mask at all times. If you and your family members follow the protocols, it is very unlikely that any of you is exposed to the virus.\n I understand. It's especially risky when kids are involved.\n Hey, you need to remind yourself that things will not be this way forever. A vaccine will be developed soon, and things will be just like they used to! When the pandemic first started, I felt like I was frozen in my life. Nothing was happening and any signs of progress had stopped. I can definetely relate. However, I found that exploring new hobbies and focusing on improving as a person were great ways to take good use of time.\n That's great! I heard that some people are even deciding to grow their own food as much as possible. That greatly helps the environment and avoids pollution and global warming. Are you planning on applying that as part of your gardenning hobby?\n It's great that you are doing an activity that you enjoy.

Unfortunately, i hate to sterotype but women do this quite often.  it depends on the severity of the information you told her. If it was something extremley important, say jail worthy, I would get rid of her immediately.  If it was something dramatic but not extremely dangerous, I would sit down and haev a serious talk with her. It all depends on the situation, how long have you known her, what is your trust in her, how close are you? Ok let me think one second. Good friends are very hard to come by and find.   i would suggest sitting down with her and explaining how serious this hurt you and that she cannot let this happen again. I would ultimately give an ultimate.  You will forgive her this one time.  If it happens again, anything even remotely similar, you part ways and say goodbye as you cannot trust her with important information.  If you give her important information and she tells everyone that's not a true friend I would advise to approach the situation as soon as possible to advocate the seriousness of the situation. Unless you don't think it's a big deal..... ;)  I know you can handle this well.  I wish you the best of luck darling.  I'm sure it will go much easier than expected but look her straight in the eyes and tell her what you want to say.  do not move eye contact\n it's at your leisure.

Another thing that you can do if nothing else works is to move to another department or even another job. But before you do that try and find out what the problem is exactly.  Maybe it is not as bad as you think. In situations like this people tend to feel more powerful when they withhold information.  They are more than likely very immature and insecure. That is a perfect example of immaturity.

It can be tough, especially in New York things are not that great health-wise. I am glad they make you get tested and you feel safe. That is the most important thing. That sounds like an amazing job!  Is the job good only temporarily? Like do you aim to keep this job or is it only a holiday job? How would you approach asking the manager if your job is in danger if you were to do that? Well, I remember once being unsure of my job. I approached my manager and with all professionalism, I asked if there was any way I can do more for the work. That helped me at the time. I never specifically asked if my job was in danger, though.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you feel comfortable talking to your manager? I am glad I was able to help. I hope I helped you feel at least a little better today.",

Is there anything in particular that is bothering you? Me too, winter can be rough.  Do the people around you value your work?  Sometimes I get seasonal depression during winter, I'd say it's relatively common. If they value your work, then you must be objectively doing okay. Maybe you shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Have you tried exercise? Research shows it can help with depression. Depression can be caused by atrophy of certain brain regions... Getting the blood flowing can help.  Exercise probably will help self-esteem too. Yes, putting on your shows is often the hardest part.  shoes* With proper health, things grow better in time, like a plant.  we're only human, lol.

If that is the case, create a personal meeting with you and your friends (the ones who banned you).  just to clarify, are these online friends?  Have you met them in person? and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally? I'm sorry to hear that.  The best advice I can give you is to try to get your friends together on a private group call.  Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation.  However, if they do not respect your response, then they can't really be relied on as your friends.  They don't come to respect you so it is best for you to move on.  Nobody should demoralize another person and that is what your \"online friends\" are taking advantage of.  Also send a report to Sony about the ban.  I believe with the proof, they can appeal the ban for you! In that case just keep reporting them.   Ah I see!  Don't get your nephew banned! how close are you to your nephew? If he's relying on your payments for the content, then I suggest for you to stop the payments until he learns his lesson.  He clearly does not respect you so you need to set up some discipline and ground rules.  Honestly, he's your nephew.  So the fault lies on his parents.  But I really do hope you get your account back.  I'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend.  And I hope my advice/suggestions have been helpful! You're very welcome!

My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is. \n Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?\n Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why. \n I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues. \n Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation. \n This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation. \n I think that would definitely help!\n What are some things you like to do?\n You have to know that it wasn't your fault.

Do you think you are possibly expect too much in terms of achievements? As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  \"normal people\" and being \"average\" really mean.

It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue. How long has this isolating been occurring? I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER. There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend. I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him. I am glad to provide suggestions like AA and other support groups. What else can I help you with? Were my suggestions helpful? I feel that the right suggestions can help.

One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person.  On FB in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if I  could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so I just picked women.  I was just thinking of ideas for me to make local friends too. Perhaps you could invite people to your home for Christmas, then when they say they have something occurring, perhaps they will realize you are alone and then invite you?  Are there any churches feeding people on Christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.  \n I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the FB search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too.  There always seems to be people in the same boat I am in, it is just a matter of thinking outside the box and perhaps even calling friends and asking for suggestions.\n I will definitely say a prayer that you find some people to share a meal with.  You are welcome. Don't give up, keep trying. It is hard. I've been alone a few times in my life and while I like to be alone, sometimes I really want some people in my life! :D   I totally get it.

Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?  Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately.  I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?  What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free  That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?  Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have.  There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?  I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot!

Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life.

Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.\n I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground. Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman. I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can.  If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it.

        "solution": "Solution: Hello, how are you tonight? I'm doing well how can I help you tonight? I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask? I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests? I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?  Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family? We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job? Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions.

        "solution": "Solution: Hello! How are you tonight?\n I'm sorry to hear you are freaking out. Perhaps a friendly listening ear can encourage you? Why are you freaking out? Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down.  That's a difficult decision you have made.  Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor?  I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave.  Do you have a plan in place? My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.  \n Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive? \n I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.  Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.  I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.  My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.  He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it.  Ouch! That sounds painful to look at.  People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will \"hear\" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.  How long have you been married? That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.  Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.  I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God.  If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.  And I urge you to get a counselor.  You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children. \n It's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it. That's a big plus on yoru side.  I'm glad to hear it. Keep the faith, all will be well in due time! Sometimes rough roads really work out, but it never FEELS that way!  You have a good night! :D",

There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don't mind the location, I am sure you would  be a good fit for these. I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application.

I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation.  They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire \"temp-to-hire\" with the expectation of hiring temp workers. Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.  Happy holidays and best wishes to you.",

        "solution": "Solution: Hello, how are you?\n What's wrong, do you feel like sharing? I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.  His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side. Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out? What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him. im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk",

How are you feeling about COVID? I think so. I have my fingers crossed.  How are you feeling during this pandemic?  I understand. I have also been on edge during these times, one thing I did do is take all the precautions I could to ease my anxiety.  I am unsure at the moment. As the weeks continue I am sure we will hear more about the side effects. How are you coping during these times?  I am not. Are you? I am very appreciative of those front line workers, I often think about how hard it might be to be in their position. One thing I do during my time at home (because we spend so much time at home) is to do yoga. It really helps stabilize my mood and be stress free from the virus. There are several of free Youtube that are amazing!  Of course anytime! I wish you the best. On the bright side, everything will hopefully get better soon. Very nice to talk to you as well.  Thank you! Have a great rest of your day.",

So it sounds to me like you're experiencing stress about choosing between staying in your current relationship, or staying close to your family. Do I have that right? I can understand how that feels. Anybody would have a hard time deciding between those options. May I ask you a question about your relationship? Compared to other relationships that you've had in the past, how strongly do you feel about this one? That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision.  Have you talked this out with your family and your partner together? How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner? So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right? I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not.  You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.

        "solution": "Solution: Hello, how are we doing today? I am doing swell What's on your mind today? How long has this depression been looming over you? I am sorry to hear that, you mentioned that you have been getting migraines lately though you have been depressed for a longer duration, lets try to pinpoint that cause first Would you say that the migraines are a result of working? you'd be surprised as how much stress actually does to the mind itself. Has anything in your daily life, in the past month alone, changed that would lead to increased stress that you wouldn't normally experience? from where I am, most businesses require us to work form home. Is this true for you? Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently. Has your daily routine changed at all in the past month?\n are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines Glad to know my advice is worth something, afterall I am not a doctor Nice speaking with you!",

Oh wow I feel you. I have loved ones that have gone through the same thing as you. They were starting to feel super down about themselves. I tried my best to support and encourage them not to give up. What industry do you work in? With the pandemic, a lot of interviews are done through Zoom and of course not everyone is at the best through video That's rough :/ I assist in managing some Airbnb properties and they've been hit so hard because of the pandemic. At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine. Honestly I had one friend who had been looking for a job for over a year and he just got an offer last month. They just kept persevering, even if that included applying to 30+ jobs each week My friend works in tech (I don't know what exactly he does since it all goes over my head lol) but I know that he took a lesser position and smaller pay than he had before. He is trying to steer his career in a different direction so I do believe it will work out for him and for you :) No problem :) As long as you keep working at it, I definitely think it will work out for you. Who knows, maybe you'll end up loving this new direction in life!\n I hope you know that you have people who will encourage you every step of the way (even strangers :) )! This pandemic has been really rough but I have to keep reminding myself to count myself lucky for staying healthy. I hope you will be safe until the vaccine and after :) I believe in you! Yes I think people should be more supportive of each other, especially during these times! Just don't ever give up! I'm really glad that I was able to be of help/support today for you :) You're welcome :) I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a great 2021 :) Bye!

Have you been able to apply for work recently? you are right about others looking for work too. Are you signed up with many job seeking apps? Feelings of insufficiency can be such a stumbling block when looking for work. It is obvious that you are putting forth great effort.  Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you? Perhaps there are a few agencies in your area to help and you can maximize your opportunities. You mentioned feeling down in the beginning of the conversation, would you like to talk about that? Tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation. When I am feeling especially low or tense, I find that helping others significantly helps my disposition. Would volunteering be something that appeals to you? That would be great! There may also be opportunities to help out online until we can be more free to move around safely. It is important to be safe for us and others. I know that there are many different opportunities available. If you google \"places to volunteer online\", they will have a list. Including places  like The Smithsonian and Crisis Text Line. You are more than welcome.!! I expect life to start looking up for you. Best wishes, I'm glad we spoke. you too",

That's a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? And the teacher wouldn't budge? Was this for a course that was required for a major? Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered. I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too. Exactly! You've got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.

I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too Can you give me some more details? That is completely understandable I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn't and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers\n I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. Is that what you are going to school for? What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don't think you will have any issues finding a job.

It's good that you were able to find another job, but I completely understand about the take home not being enough. Do you work full time, or is it just part time for now? Oh, I understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. Is there anything you can do to limit exposure? Also, are you able to look for a second job at all? The extra hours may bring in extra income while you try to find a single job that would pay enough. It sounds like you're really frustrated. That's completely understandable. That is very frustrating. I know I find it very annoying when I see people out and about without masks. It drives me crazy, just thinking about how they're keeping this stupid pandemic going and keeping people out of work. I wish I had more suggestions for you. I think the only thing you can do is keep looking, make sure your resume is updated and current. If there are any employment agencies in your area, they may be worth looking into. And if there are any public assistance programs you qualify for, there's no shame in seeking help when you need it. I sure hope it does. I wish you all the luck in the world. You're very welcome.

Having someone you are comfortable with may help to calm the anxiety while you are out. \n I have also had anxiety in the past when in public places, so I know how it feels to be anxious while out. \n Another thing that may help is having some headphones in attached to your phone or an MP3 player so you can have some calming music or something in your ear while you are out.\n I found that distractions were great for me too! \n Whatever music you think would be best would be a good idea. \n Do you have a stress ball or something you can keep with you in your pocket while out? \n I think picking up one of those and having it with you might also help!\n You're very welcome!\n Thank you, you too!",

        "solution": "Solution: Hello, I am here to listen. How are things going? I understand how you feel. It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct? Who is treating you badly? Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you? That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.  Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?  It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration. I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return. From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about. I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.  Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.  Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it.

You're not alone in feeling this way, but that doesn't change how hard it can be.  Yeah, sometimes job postings feel fake. In the past, I've found various jobs online. Sometimes it takes a while but if you keeping putting out applications, something good will come your way eventually It sounds like you're worried about your skillset. Is there any way you can improve or learn new things? You seem like a bright, open minded person. I think you could learn a lot in a new role. There are many online retailers that could be a great opportunity.  There are still many brick and mortar stores that will open after the pandemic is over, hopefully that will bring opportunity.  Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online. Thank you, I enjoy talking with people and helping them in any way I can Wow, learning french must be fun. If you can learn another language, I have faith you can learn new skills for a job. That's really great, good for you! Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help! Are there any other fields of work you are interested in working besides retail?  I would recommend calling the company or searching for a contact via LinkedIn or just google and trying to make a connection there. LinkedIn has helped me many times in the past when I'm applying for jobs. Earning a license for loans or for real estate sounds like a great way to add to your skillset. No, I do not have the premium package Typically I will search for a company and then look at the employees based on that search. If I see anyone who I have a common connection with or just something similar, I reach out. There is also a site called UpWork. I do not have personal experience with it but have heard it's a good way to make a bit of money while unemployed. They have small jobs for people to complete.  Yes that may be the case.

        "solution": "Solution: Hi! How are you tonight?\n I'm doing fairly well, Thanks. Can I encourage you or support you in some way? You sound as if you are in a slump. I've been there. Perhaps defining the problem and some solutions can help? What are your hours? I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily.  9 to 11 would exhaust me. That is 14 hours?  I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?  The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.  Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no. I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you. Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.  That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is. No one can work 24/7.  I think they may not even be aware you are struggling. So communication is important.   You don't want to crack. It's not worth it.   I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR.   This has been a stressful year for many of us, you don't need to be working yourself into depression and exhaustion.  You really do not NEED a reason not to work unreasonable hours.  It isn't anyone's business what you do on your off hours.  I do suggest you simply stick to the facts. These are the hours, I can't work more.  You don't need to explain that to anyone. But be firm and polite. And you are very welcome. Sometimes we just need a friend! :D I've been in that boat before. It isn't easy, but I learned what I had to do, and I don't get in that boat anymore. And I can see to help others get out. Amen!  GREAT!  I'm glad to hear it! Thank you! I'm retired but do community work! :D Am considering getting an office. I do love to encourage! YOu have a blessed day!",

Is it possible to get any sort of tuition to prepare for the exam?  I am very sorry. I remember very well the stress of exams and the horrible feeling that you might fail.  I can tell how insecure you are feeling about this. Does it help to let you know that you are not alone?  Are they normally understanding of things like this? Do you have a good boss?

Okay which family member is that that you are talking about?  I see. Family arguments are unfortunately very common so try not to worry too much about it. Do you really need to keep this person in your life though? If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?  I am really sorry to hear this. I was in a similar situation with a family member a couple of years ago. I know how tiring it can be.  Have you talked to any of your other family members about this?  What is it that she did today? I can hear the frustration and anger you are experiencing and I hope that I will be able to do something to help you  I am sorry to hear this. It sounds like she is being rather toxic. Have you considered getting professional help about this? Would she be prepared to address her issues too?  Well I do not think that that would be a good thing to do. That would be putting you in the wrong.  I think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens. Can you try to just think that she does not exist and not obsess about her?  I hope that I've been able to be of some help to you and thank you for talking. Enjoy the rest of your day!",

It definitely can be challenging finding work in a pandemic but don't give up keep searching I am sure you will find something.  I are capable of doing whatever you decide, maybe try going back to school.  Or you could try a career center that will assist with resumes, interviews, and job searches. What is it hard for you to get? Maybe try reaching out to Human Resources of the company you are applying for to see what qualifications and experience they are actually looking for. You have to stay encouraged keep trying, it's easy to give up. Well have you thought about changing professions just until thing in your field pick back up? I understand that you want to do what is enjoyable but how to you know you will not enjoy something else if you don't give it a try?

        "solution": "Solution: Hello\n Have you talked to someone about this? I understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. Some people want to help! Life is definitely worth living for. Talking to someone you are close to, like a family member who cares about you, can definitely help. Can you try talking to someone? What about close friends, or people you care about? I am sure they would not want to lose you. I care Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is. I used to be really sad about life too. However, helping others who are sad helped me become happier, knowing that I am helping others also become happier. Take a deep breathe and think about any happy memories. If you are sad right now, the only way is up from here! I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason.  Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.  Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? If you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. Have you tried any different ways?  Or would you be open to trying any of those different options?",

That definitely is a very impactful event, but you've already been so strong for reaching out. I think it would be okay to allow yourself grieve because in a sense the person you were has now changed due to this event. I understand, I had a similar event where I was taken advantage of with similar feelings.  I personally decided to share all my feelings with my new partner and we went very slow only doing things I was comfortable with. That may be a strategy you could use to help move back into having a sexual relationship with someone. In good relationships both partners have mutual respect for each which extends into their sexual relationship.  Remember you haven't lost your self worth, and you deserve someone who respects you. Your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience.  By sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple. Another thing that could help you navigate new relationships is counseling.  I've had counseling sessions that have greatly helped me in the past. Of course!  I think we must support each other in our times of need.",

It sounds like you are being bullied at work. Is that right? I can definitely understand why that would e so stressful for you. It hurts when your hard work goes unrecognized.  Have you tried asking your boss for a one on one talk where you can talk about ways you can improve? I did that before and I found that it was super helpful in seeing a new perspective about me. And please don't think you are disliked because you are obese. I can assure you, you are beautiful.  Okay, well maybe that may be a good place to start with your boss? I think it will be a great place to start. Sometimes it helps to reach out and hear other's perspective of you.  What do you think about that suggestion? Are you hesitant about it? And I think everyone is beautiful. You are definitely right about beauty being relative. I personally choose to see the beauty in everything and it has made life a lot more beautiful for me.  That's great! How about your coworkers. Do you feel like it might be worth talking to them about what they have been doing to you?

        "solution": "Solution: Can you please share what is on your mind? I see. You feel unlucky and disappointed that the teachers cause your courses to be challenging? Course work is already stressful enough but to be challenging in addition only adds to the pressure. I remember an English teacher of mine, always calling me out in class, saying that she expects better of me when my papers weren't the best. Her class was hard and I worked hard to complete my assignments as instructed. Instead of her speaking with me personally, she'd embarrass me. I did not like her class at all.  Is there enough time to maybe select more compatible teachers or speak with the school counselor about classes that work best for you? That is a great idea. I'd encourage you to speak with your school counselor to share your needs and maybe the 2 of you can come up with a plan to create a schedule with teachers that can help you be successful.  I believe you are correct! Less stress certainly creates a better learning environment. School counselors are your ally. Remember, you can go to them anytime you need them. Are you stopping by this week? I am so excited for you! This is a big step! Looking out for yourself, to assure you are happy, less stressed and learning the important things to be able to graduate. For your next year, asking upperclassmen about their teachers can give you insight on who you may have next year. The more you know in advance, the better you can plan for what to discuss with your counselor. So proud of you! I know you 2 will come up with an awesome schedule! Good Luck!",

Do you feel that perhaps you are playing video games as a distraction from how bad the world is at the moment?  Ah, so it's a long term hobby? I do love gaming myself I have to admit.  Could you perhaps set yourself some strict boundaries, like you can only do a certain number of hours of gaming a day?  It sounds like you might have a genuine addiction to gaming. Do you think you might benefit from some counselling? There are organisations that can help.  Well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. And it's best to catch these things before they get worse.  Have you been getting into trouble with your teachers about this or has no-one noticed so far?  Does your school have a counsellor?  Do you feel that they have not been of any help?  There are always external counsellors that you could speak to. How would you feel if, for instance, you were never allowed to game again? Would that significantly affect your quality of life?  I do understand that it can be very difficult to open up about having a problem  The trouble is that sometimes the person with a problem can be the last to actually realise it  I hope that I've been able to give you something to think about :) It's been nice to talk!

If they don't see on the same level as you do then maybe it is time to seek new friends.   It takes time to build friendships and relations.  The best way to establish the connection is to find individuals who share similar interests with you.  There is no harm to approach people and introduce yourself.  Find some common interests by asking a few questions.  If you like the individuals' personality and if they seem genuine then you can seek a stronger connection.  Anime you say?  I love anime as well!  For me, I use the interest of anime to seek groups who are interested in anime as well. There are plenty of individuals who shares common interests like you do!  Do not let other's opinions hinder your judgement.  I highly suggest joining open online forums like reddit.  There you can find anime groups that you can join.  They will be more than happy to share similar interests with you.  I highly recommend for you to join an anime club or group.  These places are great for you to establish a strong connection with others through shared interests.   Anime clubs are found in schools and on social media! They have one?  That is fantastic!  Don't be afraid!  They will love to take you in as a member don't worry.   Part of finding new friendship is to put aside any doubts and uncertainties and say \"what the heck\" and just go for it!

What happened that made you guys break up?\n I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn't the right timing or she had other interests.  The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I've had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. What is your age?\n You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.  Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn't in love anymore? Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating? Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?\n Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives.  I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn't get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator. I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this.

It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right? This must be very hard on you. How does this make you feel?\n Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.  I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!\n People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.  I think that is a good approach. You will get through this! Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better.

Join a group of some kind?  What about something like a book club or a gym?  You never know, you might also find a date there :)  No you are not. Thinking like that is a symptom of depression. It is perfectly normal but there is help available.  I do understand. I have suffered severe depression and I know how debilitating it is. Can you see your doctor?  Would you be prepared to take medication? I know a lot of people hate the idea but it can really help.  I was talking about anti depressants :). I use prozac and it helps a lot.  Yes - it is an anti depressant drug that was developed about thirty years ago. It works by preventing your brain from reuptaking serotonin Serotonin actually makes you feel good. In a  depressed person it can be reuptaken by the brain too rapidly however, leaving you feeling low. Prozac prevents this from happening.  I hope I have been able to help you. Enjoy your day!

        "solution": "Solution: Hi, how are you doing? It sounds like it would be quite frustrating for your friend to talk way too much on the phone.  My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation? I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk. Wow--that does sound annoying that he will repeat the same pattern the next time. That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends. What do you get out of the friendship with this other person? That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations? I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him. I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.  Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people.  Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.  Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation. Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded. The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more. Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation? That sounds really helpful. Sometimes people also play phone games or with a fidget spinner. I like your idea of looking on the internet. You are very welcome. I wish you all the best! Bye!",

        "problem": "Problem: My grandfather's brother passed away a few days ago and I'm depressed because of it.",
        "solution": "Solution: Hello! How are you doing today? That's great, especially around this time of the Holidays. So, how are things in your life? I'm very sorry to hear that. Not being able to be with family when something like that happens is incredibly difficult, those are the people you want to be around the most. I actually had a death in a family a few months ago as well, with a virtual funeral. I really empathize with the way you and your family are feeling. But you know, I tried to look at the virtual funeral as a way for so many people to pay tribute in a way they couldn't in person. People from all over ge\nt their chance to say goodbye. Truly, everyone got to participate and pay tribute together. Virtually or not, you were all together. That's a great way to look at it. In a year where COVID had gotten in the way of so many plans, I think it's really great to try and extract the best experience we can. Exactly, trying to be safe together to keep everyone else safe. Looking out for one another is something this year has made really important. I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you dealing with that loss? I'm glad to hear you're doing alright. The lack of human connection and socialization this past year has definitely been very difficult. Absolutely no problem, getting your thoughts out and talking things out helps me so I'm glad I could help you.",

        "problem": "Problem: Since I have to practice social distancing and isolate with the pandemic, I have been feeling more depressed. I miss hanging out with my friends and family.",
        "solution": "Solution: Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? I'm very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide.  What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this?\n That's great! \nWhat ways do you think you could communicate more with your family?\n You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed? Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off-hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods? Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that? Well, it's worth a try, right! Thank you for allowing us to complete this task as well. I know depression can cause us to lose motivation, so I really appreciate it. I hope you feel better. You are welcome. Goodbye.",

I understand it must be hard to deal with I myself have a daughter. Did you press charges?

That's true alot of people dont come forward with sexual assault due to being not believed. \n She was very brave, and is a role model for others!\n Yes friends are very helpful, Im glad she had that. \n Therapy can be a great thing especially if you find that one therapist you feel comfortable with.

        "solution": "Solution: Hi, I can't see the upper box that you can see, so what brings you \nto seek support? I'm sorry, I cannot. Sadly, the program is bad.\n You will have to restate your concerns. I'm so sorry. I'm sure that would be very upsetting, and very concerning for your future. That sounds awful! Okay, so it sounds like you cannot pay the bills, you are looking for a job, and the economic situation is tough right now due to the pandemic. This is your main concern for the conversation, then? To discuss how to secure another job?\n Have you consulted with a job center, a life coach, or any other resource such as online websites? These may be useful.\n \n I am sure you will be able to get a new job if you have the commitment. Maybe you can tell me a little more about what type of job you are looking for? Okay, that sounds like a great start. Many jobs have moved to being remote, so I can see that as a great alternative. I know there are many covid tracing jobs by phone that pay well. Have you searched for those on any online websites? Would that interest you?  Wow, that is terrific! I know those are in high-demand right now, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did call you back. Your experience will definitely make you more marketable as well.\n Have you had anyone look at your resume to see if improvements could be made while you wait? Okay, that's great. Today, many resumes are not screened by humans, but by computers, analyzing for key words, first. You are welcome. I hope you don't give up, and stay optimistic! It sounds like you have a great start.",

        "solution": "Solution: Hi! How are you feeling today? I know sometime it's really frustrating. I am pretty sure you will definitely able to find one. \n  May I know your requirements for the place other than closer to work? would you like to share the accommodation? I am really sorry to know about that. Your partner should understand your situation. You should search online or ask your friends or family for help if you they live nearby.  It is really hard to find a good place to live. Time and money are sometime the big constraints but we should keep trying.  It is always hard to find true friends. You must be a strong person and I know you can achieve anything.  Believe in yourself and don't give up. Definitely some solution will be around.  I am really sorry to hear about that. I also got laid off and was worried, then I start searching online work. Found it and doing it now. Hope it will work for you too. At this tough time we need to stay motivated and keep trying.  I really like talking to you, hope it will help you in staying positive. There is no harm in taking doctors advice. Sorry to here about that. you can try online counselling. there are so many website offering free counselling sessions. you can search on google I would suggest follow your routine, stay motivated and keep looking to for the new place. Sometime sitting with the partner and having conversation with the person might help.   Have you ever tried to quit this habit or had counselling before?  That might be the reason.  It is not impossible to quit it. you just need bit guidance.  I can understand is is not that easy. Time is really tough right now. We as human being nothing is impossible for us to do. Problem like  drugs can be quitted if we stay strong and determined.  It is hard to say that drugs can not make us normal.   I can understand your situation. You think that its normal for you but other has different outlook. I think same thing is happening between you and your partner.   It was nice talking to you. Take care and stay positive.  Bye",

        "problem": "Problem: I don't feel respected at work. I've put in many years and I think I've done a really good job. I think I've always gone above and beyond what's required of me. But my annual evaluations always come back as just meets expectations. Recently found out my boss is hiring a new person to train to take over his position when he retires. A bit upset that I wasn't considered. Would like to find a new job but the job market in general right now isn't very good.",
        "solution": "Solution: Feeling undervalued at work is frustrating, especially after years of dedication. Since your evaluations don’t reflect your efforts, consider having a direct conversation with your boss to understand what’s holding you back from higher ratings or advancement. If you’re being overlooked for leadership opportunities, ask for specific feedback on what skills or experience you need to grow. While the job market may be tough, start networking, updating your resume, and exploring new opportunities discreetly. Even if you don’t switch jobs immediately, positioning yourself for a better role elsewhere can give you more leverage and confidence in your current situation.",
